## Projects

### [Coding Challenge Platform](https://github.com/shadowfightbeast/code-judge) | Go, React, Kafka, Docker, Redis | Nov 2024

- Developed a full-stack coding platform enabling users to solve and submit problems in C++, Java, and JavaScript with real-time feedback.
- Architected a Kafka-based job queue system to decouple submission handling from API server, ensuring high throughput and fault tolerance.
- Built a Docker-based code execution engine, launching isolated containers per submission to compile, run, and validate code securely.
- Implemented a worker service in Go to consume jobs, process code execution, and persist results to PostgreSQL.
- Integrated JWT-based authentication, user problem history, problem dashboard and a responsive React UI for seamless user experience.

### [Bahano](https://businesskosh.in/)
This project aims to combat fraudulent practices in team hiring. Business owners often offer signing bonuses to attract teams, but employees may collect these bonuses from multiple businesses without actually joining any. Our secure network platform tackles this issue. Upon joining a team, employees submit ID verification. The system then notifies all businesses who offered bonuses, allowing them to recoup funds if needed. Additionally, integrating with government ID verification systems strengthens legitimacy checks. This network fosters transparency, protecting both businesses and legitimate job seekers.
